# RapidEdit: Real-Time Instruction-Based Image Editing

## Overview

**RapidEdit** is a cutting-edge real-time instruction-based image editing tool designed to provide high-quality image edits through natural language prompts. The system integrates advanced generative models for efficient and precise inpainting tasks, allowing users to apply complex image modifications with minimal latency. By combining **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)**, **LCM-LoRA** (Latent Consistency Model with Low-Rank Adaptation), and the **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**, RapidEdit overcomes the key challenges in real-time image editing: speed, spatial control, and instruction complexity.


## Setup

1. Install the SAM model using the following command: "wget -q https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth"
2. Install all the dependencies by running this command: "pip install -r requirements.txt".
3. Run the streamlit application: "streamlit run app.py"
